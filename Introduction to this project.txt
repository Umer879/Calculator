Introduction The Most Important Concept:
Of course! Here's a clear and concise explanation of both `substring()` and `eval()` in English ‚Äî perfect for including in your GitHub project README or documentation:

---

### ‚úÖ **1. `substring()` Method**

The `substring()` method in JavaScript is used to extract a portion of a string between two specified indexes.

#### üîπ **Syntax:**

```javascript
string.substring(startIndex, endIndex)
```

* `startIndex`: The position to start extracting.
* `endIndex` *(optional)*: The position to stop (not included in the result).

#### üîπ **Example (Calculator Use Case):**

```javascript
let input = "123+";
input = input.substring(0, input.length - 1); // Result: "123"
```

> **Use in calculator**: This is useful when implementing a "backspace" button to remove the last character from the current input.

### ‚úÖ **2. `eval()` Function**

The `eval()` function evaluates a string as a JavaScript expression and executes it. It can convert a string like `"2+3*4"` into a real calculation and return the result.

#### üîπ **Example:**

```javascript
let expression = "2+3*4";
let result = eval(expression); // Result: 14
```

> **Use in calculator**: When the user enters a full expression (like `12+7/2`), `eval()` calculates the result and displays it.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**

Using `eval()` can be risky if you're dealing with untrusted input, as it can execute any JavaScript code. It's fine for small, controlled projects like a calculator, but it's not recommended for larger applications without proper input validation.

### üìå **Summary:**

* `substring()` is used to manipulate or trim the input string.
* `eval()` is used to evaluate and calculate the entered mathematical expression.
